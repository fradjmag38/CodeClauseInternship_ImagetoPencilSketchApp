# CodeClauseInternship_ImagetoPencilSketchApp

This project demonstrates the use of neural style transfer to transform an input image into a pencil sketch. 
It utilizes a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract content and style features from the input image and a reference style image,
and then combines them to create a unique pencil sketch effect.

# Requirements

# Description
in this project you will input two images:
1- the content image that you would transfer it
2- pencil drawing style image (you can change a lot of style image and see which one give you the best output)
